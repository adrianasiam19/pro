First project
This code creates a simple to-do list application using Tkinter, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete tasks along with marking them as complete, including setting reminders through a calendar interface.
2nd project
This Python script uses Tkinter to create a graphical user interface (GUI) application that fetches and displays weather information for a given location using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can enter a city name, click a button to retrieve the weather data, and view details such as temperature, humidity, and weather description.
